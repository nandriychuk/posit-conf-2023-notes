## The Need for Speed - AccelerateR-ing R Adoption in GSK [TALK-1068] -Ben Arancibia, GSK

AccelerateR program - the team of R experts sits side by side with the study teams. The typical training approach for statisticians on R didn't work because the difference between the training and application/adoption by programmers was 12-18 months. the decision was made to move all the training to the on-demand training

Steps:

-   Identify the study that expresses the need to work with AccelerateR team

-   Make sure the team had acess to R and has it set up

-   Week long training (about an our a day with training specially tailored to the team)

-   Sit side by side with four week iterations

-   In close out the code that has been developed by the team is put it in the code library

## Serenity Now, Productivity Later: Focus Your Project Stack with The Gonzalez Matrix [TALK-1065] - Patric Tennant, Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute

The Eisenhower Matrix:

-   x-axis Urgency

-   y-axis: Importance

The Gonzalez Matrix (proposed by speaker, named after his boss :) ):

-   x-axis Value

-   y-axis: Effort

high value low effort -\> YES

high value hight effort -\> YES. requires a lot of time and most likely collaboration

low value high effort -\> NO

low value low effort -\> delegate to a more junior member who can learn from it

How should you talk about effort and value?

1.  Systematically, transparently, open-minded(ly)

2.  Assess contextual factors (e.g., mission and vision, competitive advantage, key relationships)

3.  Track time and impact
